# exampleNg


## Intro
ExampleNG is a trial project for working with a solution with basic complexity and a moderately arge amount of interacting components and services. It's build in angular-cli, supporting the usual ng commands. Officially a MVW application, we urge you to tell me if something doesnt work conform convention. 

## dependencies
Wherever possible, try to encapsulate 3rd party functionality into separate services/components. 

### Lodash
The filterservice uses lodash for looping. 

### momentsjs
For dates. Javascript has bad dates.

### ng-rx/state
Redux for angular2, handling of application state.
